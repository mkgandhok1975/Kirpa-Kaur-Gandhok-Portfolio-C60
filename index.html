          <b> Hello, my name is Kirpa and I would like to share with you some information about me. I love coding and really like my coding teacher Mrs. Anjali because she teaches me the coding concepts in such a way that I am easily able to understand it fluently, get a deeper understanding of it, and even helped me get a long-term memory of that coding concept. I also love playing tennis and am very passionate about it. I even play tennis for about 4-5 days a week with my dad for 1.5-2.5 hours. I also love learning more in the 4 main school subjects which are English Language Arts, Social Studies, Math, and Science. Also, during the school year, I take a religious class every Sunday and there are even some days in which we have fun activities plannes for us such as bouncy houses, ice cream truck (ICE CREAM ! WOO HOO !), and face painting, balloon animals, and even the best of all, arts and crafts like drawing.  </b>
